# mycode (Project Title)

One Paragraph of your project description goes here. Describe what you're trying to do. What is the purpose of putting up this repo?

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in how to install python and python3 using apt.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running. Eventually, maybe we could list Python package requirements here. You can remove this section for now, or make a note to yourself to fill it out later.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat other install steps...

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
